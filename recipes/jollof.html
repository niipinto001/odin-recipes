<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2.5 cups of medium-grain rice</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>.5 bonnet pepper</li>
    <li>.5 medium onions, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>3 small bell peppers</li>
    <li>.5 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of curry powder</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoon of hot ground chili pepper</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>.5 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dry thyme</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, scotch bonnet pepper and onions; purée. Pour out half the purée into a bowl; set aside. Add the bell peppers to the purée remaining in the blender and pulse until smooth. Add to the mixture that was set aside and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add blended vegetables along with the salt, curry powder, ground chile pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, bay leaves, ginger and thyme. Bring mixture to a boil.</li>
    <li>Stir in the rice until well mixed, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
    <li>Cover pot and let cook until rice is al dente, about 45 minutes. Check after 30 minutes; if rice is sauce-logged, remove the lid to cook off the excess sauce. If rice seems dry, stir in 1 to 2 cups water. Allow the rice at the bottom of the pot to char a bit to infuse it with a smoky flavor.</li>
